# Car Rental System

Welcome to the Car Rental System project! This system is implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Introduction

The Car Rental System is designed to manage the rental process of cars. It includes features such as adding new cars, registering customers, booking rentals, and returning cars. The system is implemented using Java and demonstrates the use of OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Features

- **Car Management:** Add cars to the system.
- **Customer Management:** Register and manage customer details.
- **Booking System:** Book cars for a specified duration.
- **Return System:** Manage the return of rented cars and calculate rental fees.
- **Reporting:** Generate reports on car availability and rental history.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the following commands to interact with the system:

- **Add Car:** Add a new car to the system.
- **Register Customer:** Register a new customer.
